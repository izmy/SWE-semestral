# SWE-semestral

The result of the semestral work is three datasets and at least two linksets linking them, all according to the Linked Data Principles, using commonly used vocabularies.

Pick three datasets from similar problem domains so that there is an overlap and you can demonstrate integration of data from various data sources with different data representations. The result should form at least 1000 triples of raw data (before linking)

Download/Extract/Scrape the datasets (or their parts). Use a script that you can re-run easily when the source data changes.
